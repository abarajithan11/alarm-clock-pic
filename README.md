# MICROPROCESSOR PROGRAMMING TO BUILD A FEATURE RICH ALARM CLOCK

•	The task was to build a feature rich alarm clock. We designed and manufactured the PCB and enclosure.
•	I was the group leader responsible for programming the microprocessor. I used multiple interrupts and certain complex methods to anticipate practical problems in usage and to debug them.
